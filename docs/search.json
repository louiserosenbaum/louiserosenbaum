    "text": "Field Goal Success by Distance in the NFL\nFor this project, I explored the FGByDistance dataset, which includes results of NFL field goal attempts by distance. This dataset provides a unique insight into how the distance of a field goal attempt influences its success rate, offering valuable data for teams to strategize their play.\nThe objective of this study is to simulate field goal success rates under the null hypothesis that distance does not affect success rates. This involves randomizing distance categories and observing how these simulated conditions compare with actual data.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs observed, the p-value calculated from our simulation suggests that the difference in field goal success rates by distance can (or cannot) be attributed to random variation. If the p-value is less than 0.05, we consider the effect of distance on success rates to be statistically significant. This analysis helps in understanding how distance might affect a team’s decision-making process regarding field goal attempts.\n\n\n\n      Row            Dist             N             Makes      \n Min.   : 1.0   Min.   :18.00   Min.   :  1.0   Min.   :  0.0  \n 1st Qu.:13.5   1st Qu.:30.50   1st Qu.: 17.0   1st Qu.: 11.5  \n Median :26.0   Median :43.00   Median :223.0   Median :173.0  \n Mean   :26.0   Mean   :43.24   Mean   :167.1   Mean   :134.3  \n 3rd Qu.:38.5   3rd Qu.:55.50   3rd Qu.:255.5   3rd Qu.:215.5  \n Max.   :51.0   Max.   :76.00   Max.   :315.0   Max.   :291.0  \n   PropMakes         Blocked        PropBlocked      \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :0.000000  \n 1st Qu.:0.4758   1st Qu.: 1.000   1st Qu.:0.004176  \n Median :0.7004   Median : 3.000   Median :0.018519  \n Mean   :0.6205   Mean   : 3.843   Mean   :0.028516  \n 3rd Qu.:0.8889   3rd Qu.: 6.000   3rd Qu.:0.029536  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :15.000   Max.   :0.285714  \n\n\n'data.frame':   51 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ Row        : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ Dist       : int  18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ...\n $ N          : int  15 107 204 197 244 298 241 211 237 238 ...\n $ Makes      : int  15 105 201 194 239 291 233 202 226 226 ...\n $ PropMakes  : num  1 0.981 0.985 0.985 0.98 ...\n $ Blocked    : int  0 1 1 0 2 2 1 5 1 1 ...\n $ PropBlocked: num  0 0.00935 0.0049 0 0.0082 ...\n\n\nWarning: The following aesthetics were dropped during statistical transformation: size\nℹ This can happen when ggplot fails to infer the correct grouping structure in\n  the data.\nℹ Did you forget to specify a `group` aesthetic or to convert a numerical\n  variable into a factor?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization features a scatter plot with attempt distances on the x-axis and success rates on the y-axis, with each point representing a distance category from the FGByDistance dataset. A fitted curve illustrates the overall trend of decreasing success rates with increasing distances. A series of simulated data points are overlayed to show potential variance in success rates under randomized conditions, highlighting the impact of distance on field goal success. The plot includes annotations for key distances where success rates markedly decline, providing insights into strategic considerations for NFL teams.\nThis study and its visualization offer insights into how strategic decisions regarding field goal attempts could be optimized based on distance, reflecting on the physical and psychological factors that influence kicker performance in the NFL. Through this analysis, we demonstrate the importance of considering distance in game strategies and the potential for teams to enhance their decision-making processes in critical moments."

    "text": "WI Gerrymandering\nThis map provides a detailed choropleth representation of Wisconsin’s congressional districts as they were defined in 2016, illustrating the election outcomes by color-coding districts according to the majority political party: blue for Democrats and red for Republicans. The intensity of each color reflects the proportion of votes received by the winning party, with darker hues indicating a larger majority. Noteworthy are the unique shapes of several districts, particularly Districts 3 and 4, which have raised discussions on gerrymandering due to their unusual boundaries and political outcomes. District 3 extends into areas like Stevens Point and Eau Claire, while District 4 encompasses a compact area around Milwaukee. The disparity in district sizes and shapes, such as the expansive District 7, hints at the complex dynamics of political representation and the distribution of liberal and conservative votes across the state. This visualization aids in understanding the geographical and political landscape of Wisconsin, highlighting both the results of the 2016 congressional elections and the ongoing conversations around districting practices."

States are outlined in black and filled with colors ranging from light to dark, with lighter shades representing a higher number of castles. The legend, labeled ‘Castles per State,’ correlates the colors with the number of castles. Notably, New York leads with 26 castles, followed by California with 20, and Texas with 18. The visualization is based on data collected in 2024, presented on a map of the US, emphasizing the geographic spread of historical castles."
